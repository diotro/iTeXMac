    @header 	The iTeXMac2 Text Storage Kit
    @abstract   This documentation comes in conjunction with the iTeXMac2 Text Attributes Kit.
    @discussion Here is a rapid description of the text storage design in iTeXMac2.
                The overall purpose is to provide the user with a performant and extendable syntax parsing.
                The text is stored in an NSTextStorage subclass: iTM2TextSorage.
                Each iTM2TextStorage instance has an iTM2TextSyntaxParser instance which purpose is to map attributes to text.
                Attributes are known indirectly through modes.
                Modes are tags that identify logically words/charachters/expression of the text.
                Each syntax parser has a shared attributes servers who really knowns
                what attributes should apply to text according to its mode tag.
                In other words, syntax coloring has two levels: syntax parsing and coloring.
                The mutability of syntax parsing is ensured by the iTM2TextSyntaxParser instances
                while the coloring mutability comes from the attributes servers variants.
                As the syntax parser and the attributes server are paired,
                it is recommanded to register them at the same time.
                This comment might not be completely relevant as implementation has become stronger.
                One question is to properly set up a view at initialization time.
                For that we use the meta values API's.

@class iTM2ModeLine
    @abstract   The line mode objects store the mode for a line.
    @discussion This discussion is not completely up to date.
				Line modes objects are assumed to represent the mode for a full line of text.
                A parser is expected to maintain an array of line objects that reflect exactly the lines of the associate text.
                The line object caches information. The offset is the line start of the corresponding line.
                This value may not be accurate if the text has been edited in a previous line.
                The parser is responsible to maintain a flag to indicate whether the offset has a good value.
                The end and contentsEnd are similar to the result of -getLineStart:end:contentsEnd:forRange:.
                The only difference is that both are relative to the beginning of a line of text.
                That way, no need to update these values if the text is edited in another line.
                The line mode contains two mutable data that store a range length and a range mode, both are unsigned int's.
                The contentsEnd is expected to be the sum of all the lengths.
                Two successive modes should not have the same value but it is not required at first glance.
                In order to avoid computing the modes, information is cached.
                invalidOffset is the first index for which the mode information might be inaccurate.
                A value of -1 indicates for example that the modes have been successfully computed,
                but it is sufficient to have the end.
                The previous and last modes are responsible of the continuity of the text stream.
                Those values make the link between a line and its preceeding line or its following one.
                Here we assume that line switch is described by an unsigned integer.
                We must understand this as the mode of the switch between the line such that
                the last mode of a line mode is the previous mode of the next line.
                Similarly, the previous mode of a line mode is also the last mode of the previous line mode.
                If this is not fullfilled, the latter line mode is considered invalid.
                Some syntax attributes must jump over eols, like the math mode for example, if a '$' is inserted,
                all the attributes before the next '$' must have a chance to change, even if the next '$' is not on the same line.
                The big question now is to discuss about the mode fixing policy.
                All valid modes are positive, a 0 mode is considered an error from a syntax point of view.

                Attributes servers are identified by the style and the variant.
                The style defines the class of the attributes server.
                The variants identifie for example the different sets of colors and fonts available.
                Any attributes server should have a default built in variant that is overriden by other variants if necessary.
                This is to anticipate changes.
                iTeXMac2 is shipped with a set of built in styles and variants.
                The user has the opportunity to override these built in variants or create new ones.
                iTeXMac2 reads as usual all its resources from built in domain to the user domain,
                such that built in is overriden by network, which is overriden by local, and finally overriden by user.
                All the style files are stored in an Application\ Support/iTeXMac2/Editor folder.
                The Editor contains folders named with the different styles.
                The style folders contain folders named with the variants.
                Those folders are file wrappers which contents are private, despite public.
                You can only edit the user domain. But you can copy the resulting files wherever you want
                to make it available to others.
