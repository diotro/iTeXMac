    @class	NSBundle(iTeXMac2)
    @abstract	This category adds support for the Application Support folders.
    @discussion We distinguish between different locations for the resources.
				These locations are ordered to allow an overriding design.
				For a given bundle, resources belong to one of the following category
				- support
				- external
				- built in,
				- embedded,
				External resources are the resources related to bundles located in one of
                1- ~/Library/Application\ Support/bundleID
                2- /Library/Application\ Support/bundleID
                3- /Network/Library/Application\ Support/bundleID
				Support resources are located in the same folders but are not external
				Built in resources are located in the bundle Resource folder
				Embedded resources are the resources related to embedded plug ins or frameworks.
				For a given bundle, categories are recursively ordered by
					support > external > embedded support > embedded external > built in > embedded built in
				That way a resource in the support category can override a resource in one of the other categories.
				Inside each category
					user > local > network
				Older discussion: iTeXMac2 and all its satellite applications are expected to look for their resources in different places. Standard places are:
                1- ~/Library/Application\ Support/iTeXMac2
                2- /Library/Application\ Support/iTeXMac2
                3- /Network/Library/Application\ Support/iTeXMac2
                4- Bundle resource/Application\ Support
                The System domain is intentionnaly left blank. If we happen to install some framework in the system domain, the inner resources will be available from the framework bundle with the standard Foundation API.
                The domain number 4 above is called the built in domain. It is in the standard resource domain of the bundle. Its contents should be considered as default values.
                Resources are searched in the order given above. If nothing is found in 1, 2 or 3, then standard API of the NSBundle object are used to access resources inside the bundle.
                In general, 1, 2 and 3 are gathered.
