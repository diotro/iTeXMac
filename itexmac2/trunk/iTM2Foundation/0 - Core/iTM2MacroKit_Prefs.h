	@abstract		Abstract forthcoming.
	@discussion		Consider this technology as experimental (to be improved and possibly deprecated in a near future), do not use it.
					This is the new architecture of macros.
					First let us define what are Macros and key bindings.
					Macros are just actions: make something or that.
					A macro can be some text to be inserted, or some action to be performed.
					A key binding is a link between a key or key sequence and macro.
					They are identified by a unique string key.
					Now, macros are gathered in a unique database, they are uniquely identified by a string key.
					How macros are stored on disk.
					The way the action is performed is stored in a file.
					Macros are stored in files in definite locations.
					Each bundle and plug in loaded by iTeXMac 2 can have its own set of macros.
					When a framework or bundle is loaded, the macro server will read the various "Macros" directories
					in the bundle and append the newly read macros to the database.
					Those "Macros" directories are expected to be localizable as a whole when wrapped in a bundle.
					The user defined macros are store'd in a Macros directory located in the user Library:
					~/Library/Application\ Support/iTeXMac2/Macros.localized
					If two frameworks define a macro with the same identifier, we do not give any rule to determine which one will have the precedence.
					The Macros will eventually override plug-ins Macros.
					Moreover, they are loaded from network, to local then user domain, each one taking precedence over its predecessor.
					When scanning the external Macros directories located in the various Application Support folder, the hash file are created at run time
					because the user is authorized to edit the contents of these forlders.
					What is the hash file format.
					The most comfortable choice is to use an XML file list containing a dictionary,
					for which values are the paths of the file containing the macro.
					Different keys can have the same value, this will occur if the macros are gathered in one file.
					
					In memory, we have 1 tree for the macros, 1 tree for all the key bindings, and one tree for each XML document stored.
					
					The macros and key bindings trees have the same architecture:
					- the root represents the Macros directory
					- the first level children represent the various shallow subfolders of the Macros directory, also known as "domains"
					- the second level children represent the various shallow folders of the domains subdirectories, also known as "categories"
					- the second level children represent the various shallow folders of the categories subdirectories, also known as "contexts"
					These trees are no deeper, from that point of view. However, the macros will add one depth level and the key bindings will add even more.
					
					For the macros tree, the leafs will be a list of macros. For the key bindings tree, the leafs will be a tree of key bindings.
					
					The macros and key bindings are stored at various locations as XML documents. Those XML document are also trees, they are managed separately.
					
					The context category hold the list of XML documents where the macros or key bindings are stored.

	@discussion		The macro design is rather complicated due to some indirection and some performance related problems.
					Macros are uniquely identified by their domain, category, context and key.
					Common domains are "Default", "Plain", "LaTeX", "ConTeXt", "MetaPost", "HTML", "XML", and so on.
					Common categories are "Default", "Document", "Text", "Math", "Custom", ...
					Common contexts are "Matrix", "Array", "Picture"...
					For example all macros concerning maths in LaTeX should be gathered in the "Math" category of the "LaTeX" domain.
					The macros are defined in different files in the different resource directories available.
					Domains, categories and contexts come from the subpath where they are stored:
					.../Macros.localized/domain_name/category_name/context_name
					Macros directly stored under
					.../Macros.localized/domain_name/category_name
					have a void context
					Macros directly stored under
					.../Macros.localized/domain_name/
					have a void category and context.
					<P/>
					 All the following is not accurate and should not be relied on.
					<P/>
					In general, those folders are built in bundles or plugins, such that they are perfectly known at ship time.
					As they are expected to contain a great deal of macros, we are relying on some already existing index.
					Those indexes are created at build time.
					What is the information contained in a macro?
					We already talked about the identifier part (domain, category, context, key 4uple),
					we now have to describe what really makes the macro.
					Actually a macro is just an action and an argument.
					The action is a selector name, corresponding to a message sent down the responder chain.
					If necessary, the action will have an argument. In general, this is a string argument...
					The macro should also contain some meta information. Some human readable information might be helpful.
					In order to make localization easier, at least initially, the macro title and description are gathered in an external file.
					This allows to simply duplicate a Macros folder and translate only one file,
					being sure that the macros are consistent between the various languages, (but this is not a requirement).
					
					iTeXMac2 project contains a tool to parse all the macro files with the same category in the same domain,
					and cache a key -> path dictionary in an index to indicate what keys are available
					and the path of the file where they are defined.
					When the server is asked for a macro given its key, context, category and domain,
					it goes to its cache to see if this macro is already available,
					if not, it uses the correct path to execute the macro.
					For example, old design macros are often gathered in one property list or xml file.
					The server will read the file and extract the relevant information,
					then it will use this information to perform the desired action.
					For perl macros, the macro server will just let the perl interpreter take the appropriate information from the same file.
					This means that perl macros won't certainly have to be cached.
					What is the user interface for these macros?
					Different files are involved.
					foo.iTM2MacrosMenu is an xml file containing the description of a menu.
					domain/category/.../foo.iTM2MacroIndex is a shallow standalone xml file that defines the key->path dictionary index.
					domain/category/.../foo.iTM2MacrosNames is a shallow standalone xml file defining a key->localized name dictionary
					domain/category/.../foo.iTM2MacrosTooltips is a shallow standalone xml file defining a key->localized tooltips dictionary
					domain/category/.../foo.iTM2MacrosShorcuts is an xml file defining the key combination -> key/category/domain mapping.
					The key bindings manager will use the foo.iTM2MacrosShorcuts, and if the user requests more information
					the foo.iTM2MacrosNames and foo.iTM2MacrosTooltips.
					The menu controller will primarily use the foo.iTM2MacrosMenu and foo.iTM2MacrosNames,
					and the foo.iTM2MacrosTooltips on request.
					The macro server will use foo.iTM2MacroIndex to perform the apropriate action.
					An editor should be available
					The user defined macros (category "Custom") are less numerous and will be managed on the fly with a slightly different strategy.
					Assuming that they are all user defined, we do not need tooltips nor cached macros index.

	@abstract		The localized dscription of the macro action is stored.
	@discussion		The information is initially available in 2 kinds of locations.
					1 - directly in the index files named iTM2MacrosIndex in the various
					.../Macros/domain/category
					folders available in the built in bundles.
					These files are standalone xml document containing a key -> path map to indicate where the macro are defined.
					If the path begins with a "./", it is relative to the containing .../Macros/domain/category folder.
					If the path begins with a "/" it is absolute.
					This design makes it possible to use other schemes (URLs).
					Other schemes are not yet supported and will be ignored by iTM2.
					Using a relative name authorizes to change the category name in a simple way.
					Whenn these files will be parsed, the full path will eventually be reconstructed and used.
					2 - indirectly in the various
					.../Application\ Support/iTeXMac2/Macros/domain/category
					folders available in the various domain either local, network or user defined.
					This information will be extracted at run time such that only full path will be available.
					The order in which these files are parsed is very important because it defines the overriding rules.
					For bundles, embedded frameworks then plugins then the resource folder are scanned.
					For system domains, the main bundle then the network then local then user domain are scanned.
					For each system domain, the plugins are scanned before the Application\ Support subfolder.
					Finer grain order is left undefined which means that
					if 2 iTeXMac2 plugins in the same folder define a macro with exactly the same domain, category and key triple,
					which one is chosen is not defined and may change after an upgrade.
					Each category/domain pair defines a unique name space.
					The information is initialized lazily.
					When the receiver is requested for the file name, it looks in its cached information for the answer.
					If the answer is not available, it updateContainerFileNamesForContext:ofCategory:inDomain:.
