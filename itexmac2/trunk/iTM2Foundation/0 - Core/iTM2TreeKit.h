	@class		iTM2TreeNode 
	@abstract	Leafs of a tree wrapping an ordered hierarchical dada structure. 
	@discussion	The purpose of iTM2TreeNode is first to model the simplest tree hierarchy.
				It is the direct data model for a NSTreeController.

				The hierarchy of Tree Items is meant to reflect some hierarchical data model.
				Each tree item may have a parent which it belongs to, and an array of child items.
				A Tree Item with no parent is the root of the tree,

				Of course, a Tree Item is meant to be a child item of its parent if any.
				The Parent retains its children but the child just points to its parent to avoid infinite retain loops.
				Another problem linked to Tree Models that must be avoided consists in circular reference.
				More precisely, if an item retains its parent ant the parent retains its children,
				a careless design can lead to never deallocated objects.

				Each Tree Item points to some leaf data in this hierarchy through its value instance variable
				and the child items reflect the structure of this data, namely an array.
