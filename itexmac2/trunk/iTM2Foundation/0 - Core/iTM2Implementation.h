	@class		iTM2Implementation
	@abstract	The basic implementation controller.
	@discussion	This ensures the mutability part of the implementation layer of the document architecture.
				It implements a tree hierarchy.
				It maintains a dictionary of independant model object, each one possibly stored in its own file.
				Each model is meant to be a dictionary at first glance.
				This is a very low level object and the method names can conflict with other higher level ones.
				It is not very important since the context should be clear.
				This allows to have a dynamic data model for an object.
				Developers can have unlimited instance variables when posing or categorizing.
				When an object is said to have a private iTM2Implementation,
				you can use it to extend the number of instance variables without changing the header.
				To have access to a new instance variable without changing the header (which you cannot always do)
				you just have to implement setter and getters in which you will make calls to metaGETTER and metaSETTER().
				Both macros will act on objects and will store or retrieve the arguments with a KVC like design.
				There is somehow limitations: getFoo, isFoo, setFoo, foo, _setFoo, _getFoo will all refer to the same underlying data.
				You must not use at the same time the isFoo and getFoo selectors to access different data.
