    @class	iTM2ObjectServer
    @abstract	An object server.
    @discussion	Stores objects with a two levels KVC.
                If you need to store shared instances, this object is for you.
                You are expected to
                - subclass
                - provide data storage for a mutable dictionary
                - implement a +load method where you initialize your storage
                - override the mutableDictionary to return your data storage
