    @class 	iTM2SpellKit
    @abstract	Extending cocoa spell checker.
    @discussion	Some technical note on the spell management.
                Cocoa manages languages and ignored words in a per application basis.
                However, there is a spell document tag which allows to separate spell parameters on a per object basis.
                iTeXMac2 assumes that any NSText object can have a dedicated spell context,
                with a dedicated language and dedicated set of ignored words.
                As many different NSText objects might have to share the same spell context,
                there is a notion of spell context mode, which is a unique key identifier.
                The set of known words is managed by cocoa and iTeXMac2 does not change this behaviour.
                However, there is some difficulty in tracking the changes in the language.
                The changes in spell context mode are well tracked because they are initiated by iTM2 itself.

    @discussion	The spelling context is defined by the language, and the lists of known words.
                Each NSText is supposed to have its own spelling context,
                but many different texts are allowed to share the same spelling context.
                For the moment, no question of different spelling context for different parts of the same text.
                There is a unique default spelling context that is shared by the NSText's when nothing else is available.
                This context is used by the spell checker helper to properly set the spell checker parameters.
                See the iTM2SpellCheckerHelper class for details.

    @class	iTM2SpellContextController
    @abstract	A spelling context controller.
    @discussion	The spelling context is defined by the language, and the lists of know words.
                Each logically different context is defined by a unique NSString key named the spell mode.
                Many different texts can share the same spelling context, or in short the same mode,
                and a single text split can be made of different parts
                each one having its own different spelling contexts depending on the part of the text.
                The void string @"" is the spelling context key for the default context.
                The spelling context controller is expected to manage the different spelling modes
                a document might need to use. Each document is expected to have its own spelling context controller.
                Basically, each NSDocument should have its own spelling context controller,
                and each text of any window for that document should ask the spelling window controller
                for the correct spelling context.
                iTeXMac2 situation is more delicate because the document may be split into many different files,
                each one being a document.
                In that case many different NSDocument's can share the same spelling context controller.
                There is a unique shared spelling context controller that knows different spelling modes.
                If a document does not know about a spelling context controller, the shared one is used.
                There is a remanancy of the spelling context: when the main document changes,
                and the new one has no specific requirements, the previous spelling context is used.
                The spelling context controller is just a repository of spelling contexts.
                It can load and save the contexts in given directories.
                But this object can't make the decision of the correct spelling context that must be used.
                It is the responsibility of another object with better knowledge of the environment
                (an NSDocument for example)
