	@class		iTM2TeXProjectDocument(Frontend)
    @abstract   Abstract forthcoming.
    @discussion Here are a few notes about actions.
                There are a finite number of preset actions to compile, typeset,
                make the bibliography, the index, the glossary, clean, special.
				There is a finite list of built in actions defined by iTeXMac2,
				they are given by their names in +builtInCommands.
				Default command names are:
				"Compile", "Typeset", "Index", "Bibliography", "Glossary", "Clean", "Special", "Archive"
				The Archive command will be suported after the others (and will appear in the GUI).
				We have the following organisation for each command
				Command -> script		-> contents (shell script)
										-> inspector
						-> environment  -> contents (dictionary)
										-> inspector
				There are indirection tables accessed through "modes".
				Here is a more detailed documetation of the implementation:
				Each command is identified by its name, and -is- implemented as its own name.
				To each command corresponds a script mode as the result of -scriptMode for the command wrapper
				and an environment mode as the result of -environmentMode for the command wrapper.
				Both commands have their setter counterparts.
                Each action is expected to execute the given script either built in or customized in the given environment
                The environment is edited in the editOptions: method, the name is more suitable to IB than editEnvironmentContents:.

				From the init method and from  the read methods.
				The frontend implementation is expected to "be" a mutable dictionary containing
				-   a "Commands" dictionary for which keys are the built in command names.
					It is a Command to Action mapper.
					command names give raise to the selectors of TeX menu item, namely Compile -> projectCompile:,
					Typeset -> projectTypeset: Clean -> projectClean: ...
					Values are "command descriptors", id est dictionaries with key value pairs iTM2TPFEEnvironmentModeKey
					and iTM2TPFEScriptModeKey.
					The first value will tell what kind of environment is expected by the command,
					it is one of the keys of the command environments dictionary below.
					Given a command name, we access the environment mode by sending -environmentModeForCommand: message
					and its setter counterpart -setEnvironmentMode:forCommand: to a project document.
					The second value tells what shell script will be used,
					it is one of the keys of the command actions dictionary below.
					Given a command name, we access the script mode by sending -scriptModeForCommand: message
					and its setter counterpart setScriptMode:forCommand: to a project document.
					The script mode is a string identifier used in indirection tables, one of:
								- a name given by the user to identify one of its own customised shell scripts
								- iTM2TPFEVoidMode to disable the action,
								- iTM2TPFEBaseMode to inherit the action script from the base project (including disabling).
						It means that the concrete action can be user defined or built in,
						defined in the project document itself or inherited from a base project.
						There should be no mean to change the meaning of an action.
						The built in action name is the -required- default value for base projects.
						the iTM2TPFEBaseMode is the default value for other projects.
						Then the default actions are built in iTeXMac2 with a possibility of overriding.
						The Special command is very special such that it should not be defined by base projects.
					The environment modes is a string identifier used in indirection tables, one of:
								- the built in action name
								- one of the built in action names when the script mode is "Special"
								- iTM2TPFEVoidMode for customized scripts only,
								- iTM2TPFEBaseMode to inherit the environment from the base project.
						The built in action name is the -required- default value for base projects.
						the iTM2TPFEBaseMode is the default value for other projects.
				-   a "Command Scripts" dictionary which keys are used by the command dictionary above.
					The keys are script modes and the values are script descriptors.
					A script descriptor is a dictionary containing a label for key @"label" used by iTeXMac2 internally
					and the actual shell script for key @"script".
					This dictionary only contains customized scripts such that in general, it is void.
					Only the base projects and customized ones should have a non void dictionary here.
					Given a script mode, we access the command script by sending -scriptDescriptorForCommandMode: message
					and its setter counterpart -setScriptDescriptor:forCommandMode: to a project document.
				-   a "Command Environments" dictionary which keys are used by the "Commands" dictionary above.
					They contain a dictionary which contents will be appended the the shell environment just before the action is performed.
					The contents of these value dictionaries is free.
					Given an environment mode, we access the command environment by sending -commandEnvironmentForCommandMode: message
					and its setter counterpart -setEnvironment:forCommandMode: to a project document.
				-   an "Engines" dictionary for which keys are engine names and values are engine descriptors.
					An engine decriptor is just like an action descriptor:
					a dictionary which keys are iTM2TPFEEnvironmentModeKey and iTM2TPFEScriptModeKey.
					The first value will tell what kind of environment is expected by the command,
					it is one of the keys of the engine environments dictionary below.
					To each command corresponds an engine mode as the result of -scriptMode for the command wrapper
					and an environment mode as the result of -environmentMode for the command wrapper.
					The second value tells what shell script will be used,
					it is one of the keys of the action script dictionary below.
					Given an extension, we access the script mode by sending -scriptModeForEngine: message
					and its setter counterpart setScriptMode:forEngine: to a project document.
					Engine names are typically names for standard TeX program wrappers:
					iTM2_Engine_PDFTeX wrapping pdftex, iTM2_Engine_TeX wrapping tex, iTM2_Engine_MetaPost wrapping metapost...
					But they can be customized shell script too.
					This dictionary is used by the built in compile command to map extensions to engines
					and compile files according to their extension.
				-   a "Engine Scripts" dictionary which keys are used by the action dictionary above and values are script descriptors.
					A script descriptor is a dictionary containing a label for key @"label" used by iTeXMac2 internally
					and the actual shell script for key @"script".
					Given a script mode, we access the engine script by sending -scriptDescriptorForEngineMode: message
					and its setter counterpart -takeScriptDescriptor:forEngineMode: to a project document.
				-   an "Engine Environments" dictionary which keys are used by the action dictionary above.
					They contain a dictionary which content will be appended the the shell ENVIRONMENT just before the action is performed.
					The contents of these value dictionaries is free.
					Given an environment mode, we access the command environment by sending -environmentForEngineMode: message
					and its setter counterpart -takeEnvironment:forEngineMode: to a project document.

                Now come the important notes on the TeX document architecture.
                Documents are one of:
                - projects
                - flat documents
                Projects are standard or basic (these ones are used by standard projects as delegates),
                flat documents ares standalone or owned by standard projects.
                The shared document controller ownes standard projects and flat documents not owned by standard projects.
                There is a dedicated document controller that ownes the basic project documents.
                Each standard project document has a dedicated document controller to help it managing the documents it owns.
