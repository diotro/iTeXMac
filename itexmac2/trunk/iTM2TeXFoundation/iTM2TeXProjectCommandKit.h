    @class      iTM2TeXPCommandsInspector
    @abstract   User interface for the engines
    @discussion Different points are discussed here.
                TeX Projects Names:
                They are constructed on the scheme base+output[variant].texp
                When no variant is given, it is assumed to be the word "Default"
                When no output is given, it is assumed to be the word "PDF"
                TeX Projects Properties:
                A dictionary of projects is cached. The keys are the lowercase dictionary containing base, ouput and variant.
                The objects are dictionaries containing the name and case sensitive properties.
				This inspector is the entry point to set
				what kind of engines a tex project is using to perform some basic operations on a file.
				In the GUI, there is a tab view with 3 panes
				- basic one to choose one of the built in projects and inherit behaviour from them.
				  From this pane, you choose the format, variant and output
				- Advanced one where you assign concrete actions to the menu item actions
				  A popup menu lets you choose what menu item action you are editing
				  Then you can choose a shell script for that shell script, either built in or customized
				  And for that shell script a set of parameters. We can edit these parameters with a dedicated inspector.
				  
				  NB: instead of using direct parameters for scripts I use environment variables.
				  Then I use a NSDictionary to store the environment variables,
				  and I can provide dedicated forms to edit these environment variables
				- Second advanced one where you can customize the way tex, ps, mp files are processed.
				  This panel is only suitable for compile engine.

    @class      iTM2TeXPCommandPerformer
    @abstract   The central object that performs commands.
    @discussion This object is responsible of one of the commands iTeXMac2 knows of.
				The environment must be correctly set when the commands are launched.
				Basically what is a command?
				This can be thought of a pair consisting of a shell script and an environment.
				When the command manager is asked to launch a command, it prepares the environment,
				then launches the script.
				The script and environment management is rather complicated
				to allow a better customization and user management.
				All the shell scripts dedicated to iTeXMac2 should have their name prefixed with "iTM2_".
				iTeXMac2 is shipped with a list of built in shell scripts such that in general,
				there is no need to deal with shell scripts, only environments.
				The shell scripts are located in various places, and appear in that order in the search list
				- .iTM2/bin(to be changed into $iTM2_dotFolder/bin)
				- ~/Library/Application Support/iTeXMac2/bin
				- ~/Library/TeX/bin
				- /Library/Application Support/iTeXMac2/bin
				- /Library/TeX/bin
				- /Network/Library/Application Support/iTeXMac2/bin
				- /Network/Library/TeX/bin
				- iTeXMac2.app executable path
				iTeXMac2 application support binaries take precedence with respect to the others
				User domain take precedence with respect to the others.
				If a TeX project document defines pivate shell scripts,
				they will be transmitted to the launcher through the environment.
				The launcher scans all the environment variable names for names matching the extended regexp iTM2_ShellScript_(.*)
				then it copies the contents in .iTM2/bin, in shell scripts named iTM2_\1
				(for example echo "${iTM2_ShellScript_Command_0}" > ".iTM2/bin/iTM2_Command_0")
				Then the manager sends the appropriate command to the launcher, for example the command
				[fermat:~] jlaurens% iTM2_Launch Compile
				will let iTM2_Launch perform a $iTM2_Compile whatever the contents of this environemnt variable can be.
				The manager is supposed to fill the iTM2_??? environment variable with the name of a script to be executed.
				Just before the manager launches the command, it collects the environment dictionary from the command performers.
				There are 2 parts to give different entry points to subclassers.
				In fact, many documents are supposed to share the same shell scripts.
				Moreover, the shell scripts are subject to change when new versions of TeX engines are shipped.
				For that reasons, base settings are stored in base projects.
				Base projects are stored at different places. They should be edited only by administrators.
				Each user defined project has a base project where it can find its default settings and actions.
				When actions change, the user do not have to change its own project
				because the base one will automatically take the update into account.
				This is extremely powerful and efficient but somewhat difficult to manage.
				In general, the manager uses the base project to fill all the settings,
				then the manager lets the project override the values it has overriden.
				For example, the base project defines its own Compile process and
				the iTM2_Compile environment variable will be defined accordingly.
				If the project just uses the base settings, it will leave this environment variable untouched.
				If it uses customized settings, it will fill this environment variable with an appropriate value,
				thus overriding the inherited settings. The same holds for the environment.
				However, there is a problem concerning the customized scripts.
				If a project defines customized scripts, there might be a name conflict that could cause unexpected and unwxanted problems.
				First, custom shell scripts, within one project, are identified by a 0 based tag number.
				If both a project and its base project define custom scripts, we end with two different shell scripts with the same identifier.
				Second, the customized shell scripts of the base projects are not meant to be overriden nor inherited.
				The customized shell scripts end with names iTM2_Command_? (or iTM2_BaseCommand_? if they come from the base project)
				where "?" is just the tag identifier of the shell script.
