This directory is meant to contain the Sparkle.framework
In the iTM2 svn repository, there is a zip archive of the latest Sparkle distribution.
The preparation is now to expand this zip archive if there is no Sparkle framework.
There might be some problems concerning the localization.

Last version is 1.5b6

This directory is meant to receive the source of the Sparkle framework

From the website

"With a few notable exceptions, most Mac software has really lame update functionality. Programs will usually just tell you that there’s a new version available, point you at the web site, and make you do the rest. I’m trying to fix that.

Sparkle is a module that developers can stick in their Cocoa applications (five-step install!) to get instant self-update functionality.

By that, I mean that your app will be able to update itself, not just check for new versions: it’ll read the update information from an appcast on your server, download, extract, install, restart, and even offer to show the users release notes before they decide if they want to update.

With huge projects like Adium, Colloquy, Cyberduck, Vienna, and Virtue using Sparkle (see more!), you can feel comfortable using it in your app.

It’s free, it’s easy, and it’ll make using a Mac better for everyone, so go for it!"
