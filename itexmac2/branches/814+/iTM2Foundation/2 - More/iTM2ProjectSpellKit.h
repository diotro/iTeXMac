@interface NSDocument(iTM2SpellKit)

/*!
    @method		spellContextController
    @abstract	The spelling context controller.
    @discussion	The spelling context is defined by the language, and the lists of know words.
                Each logically different context is defined by a unique NSString key.
                Many different texts can share the same spelling context,
                and a single text split can be made of different parts
                each one having its own different spelling contexts depending on the part of the text.
                Any object has at least the shared spell context controller.
                A NSText object inherits its spelling context controller from its window.
                A NSWindow object inherits its spelling context controller from its window controller.
                A NSWindowController object inherits its spelling context controller
                from its document if any or from its owner if any.
                All these default behaviours might be overriden by subclassers.
    @parameter	None.
    @result		A spell context controller.
