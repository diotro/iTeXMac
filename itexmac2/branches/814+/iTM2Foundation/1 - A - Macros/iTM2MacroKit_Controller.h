	@header			iTM2MacroKit
	@abstract		Abstract forthcoming.
	@discussion		Consider this technology as experimental (to be improved and possibly deprecated in a near future), do not use it.
					This is the new architecture of macros.
					First let us define what are Macros and key bindings.
					Macros are just actions: make something or that.
					A macro can be some text to be inserted, or some action to be performed.
					A key binding is a link between a key or key sequence and macro.
					They are identified by a unique string key.
					Now, macros are gathered in a unique database, they are uniquely identified by a string key.
					How macros are stored on disk.
					The way the action is performed is stored in a file.
					Macros are stored in files in definite locations.
					Each bundle and plug in loaded by iTeXMac 2 can have its own set of macros.
					When a framework or bundle is loaded, the macro server will read the various "Macros" directories
					in the bundle and append the newly read macros to the database.
					Those "Macros" directories are expected to be localizable as a whole when wrapped in a bundle.
					The user defined macros are store'd in a Macros directory located in the user Library:
					~/Library/Application\ Support/iTeXMac2/Macros.localized
					If two frameworks define a macro with the same identifier, we do not give any rule to determine which one will have the precedence.
					The Macros will eventually override plug-ins Macros.
					Moreover, they are loaded from network, to local then user domain, each one taking precedence over its predecessor.
					When scanning the external Macros directories located in the various Application Support folder, the hash file are created at run time
					because the user is authorized to edit the contents of these forlders.
					What is the hash file format.
					The most comfortable choice is to use an XML file list containing a dictionary,
					for which values are the paths of the file containing the macro.
					Different keys can have the same value, this will occur if the macros are gathered in one file.
					
					In memory, we have 1 tree for the macros, 1 tree for all the key bindings, and one tree for each XML document stored.
					
					The macros and key bindings trees have the same architecture:
					- the root represents the Macros directory
					- the first level children represent the various shallow subfolders of the Macros directory, also known as "domains"
					- the second level children represent the various shallow folders of the domains subdirectories, also known as "categories"
					- the second level children represent the various shallow folders of the categories subdirectories, also known as "contexts"
					These trees are no deeper, from that point of view. However, the macros will add one depth level and the key bindings will add even more.
					
					For the macros tree, the leafs will be a list of macros. For the key bindings tree, the leafs will be a tree of key bindings.
					
					The macros and key bindings are stored at various locations as XML documents. Those XML document are also trees, they are managed separately.
					
					The context category hold the list of XML documents where the macros or key bindings are stored.
