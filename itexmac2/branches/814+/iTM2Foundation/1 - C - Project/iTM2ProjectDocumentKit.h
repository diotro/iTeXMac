				Now we discuss about subdocuments of the project.
				The subdocuments are or different types.
				Either they are refering to documents relative to the project, or they are absolute documents.
				Documents relative to the project are owned by the project and are not meant to be shared by different projects.
				On the contrary, absolute documents can be shared by different projects, the typical example concerns packages
				of a TeX distribution. For them, there is a versioning problem.
				Either we want a file relative to a specific distribution, or we want a file relative to the most recent distribution.
				Here we use the TeXDist structure which gives a path for the current distribution.
				That means that we must not always resolve symlinks.
				To manage all these situations, we use URL manipulation facilities.
				
				URL's must be properly formed.
				The shared project controller allows to normalize any URL with respect to a project see [SPC normalizedURLinProjectWithURL:].

				We do rely on NSURL form.
				This means that we do not expect cocoa or anyone else to change the NSURL behind
				our back. More precisely, when an url is given with and absolute and a relative part,
				we expect that this split remains unchanged through the execution of the program.
				The base URL is something we do use actively.
				More precisely, a project URL can have 2 forms:
				<ul>
				<li>in the Application Support's Writable Projects folder, the baseURL is the URL of the
				Writable Projects folder, the relative URL starts from here.
				We call it a "Writable Project URL".</li>
				<li>in a standard location: an absolute URL.
				We call it a "Normal Projects URL".</li>
				</ul>
				
				As a consequence, the base URL of any project URL is either the Writable Projects folder URL or
				void.
				
				For document URLs, there are 2 possibilities:
				<ul>
				<li>The document does not belong to any project.</li>
				<li>The document belongs to one or many project.
				The base URL of the document URL must be either the source folder URL or the factory URL of one of its owning projects.</li>
				</ul>
				As a consequence, if the base URL is either a source URL or a factory URL, we have a document.
				
				Source and factory URLs must also contain information about their owning project URL in their base URL.
				The base URL of the source URL is a normal project URL
				whereas the factory project URL is either a normal project URL when we have write access or
				a writable project URL otherwise.
