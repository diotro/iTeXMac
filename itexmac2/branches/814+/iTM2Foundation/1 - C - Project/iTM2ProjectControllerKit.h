    @discussion The project controller maintains a list of all project documents to map documents to their projects.
				Some project documents belong to the standard cocoa document architecture 
				and are owned by the document controller. The shared project controller can own a list of projects,
				different from the ones owned by the document controller. Those are known as base projects.
				The project controller and the document controller are not meant to own both the same documents.
				Some important remark on the object to project mapping.
				Each document has a project (possibly nil) returned by the -project message.
				The default implementation just asks the shared project controller for such an object.
				For project documents, there is no need to ask the shared project controller: they are their own projects.
				Moreover, the project for document is not the designated entry point to retrieve the project of a document.

/*! 
    @method     projectForSource:
    @abstract   The project for the given source.
    @discussion Any file MUST have a project, either useful or for convenience.
				For example, if iTM2 opens a text file or a dvi file just to see the contents
				for information purpose (suppose it's just a man or doc),
				there is no need of a real project, and a shared ghost project might be used.
				Standalone short files won't need any hard project,
				typically .tex files downloaded from the web will use convenient one shot projects stored in a temporary directory.
				If the directory containing the file is not writable, all the information of the project except the file
				itself will not be stored at the same level, whether in the file through embedded resources
				or in the file system as faraway resource. In that case, projects are stored either in the temporary directory if this makes sense,
				or in a dedicated location of a Caches subfolder. If the resource is not stored with the file, we must have a strong mapping
				binding the file and the associate resource. There can be problems if the file name changes.
				Given a file, we can use either the file name or an alias to the file to retrieve the project information.
				Both means should be used. If both lead to the same project, we have found that project.
				If both do not agree for the target project, the alias target should be used preferrably.
				We need two mappings: file name -> project, alias -> project.
				All the projects are referred to indirectly. We have different means to do that.
				If we take into account the user interface, the path components con be used for such a purpose.
				As such projects are collected in only one location, their path prefix is common.
				The next components will be used as key to uniquely identify the project.
				The key can be based on the file name of the original source file and a unique key identifier.
				What is the entropy put in this key? For the moment, nothing relevant.
				Here is the common location
				<code>~/Library/Application\ Support/Writable Projects.localized/...</code>
				to which we append the full path to the source base name with the correct path extension.
				This common location is referred to <code>[NSURL factoryURL4iTM3]</code>, because the projects are not stored near the file they are bound to.

				This is the mapping file name -> project.
				
				Question, what happens if a project is not writable?
				
				The file name is significantly longer than the one of the source.
				But this should not be a problem due to the actual size limit (4096 AFAIK).
				
				However, there might be a problem if different clients want to use this strategy. If they are concurrently creating a unique key,
				it is difficult to avoid collisions when each client does not know about the other one's intentions.
				
				The final components are the ones used by the user interface to display information to the user.
				Unlimited directory level should be used.
				
				Faraway projects are used for standalone documents.

				This method is used by various other methods to ensure that some objects are really bound to a project.
				From build > 689, the policy has changed.
				No more standalone projects unless it is not possible to save.
				If there is a project located in a non writable location,
				we create a library counterpart which only contains the "Factory".
				An internal project is a directory wrapper found in the same directory or in a directory above.
				If the directory is not writable, the project is stored in an application support subfolder.
				In that case, it is called an library project.
				Let us explain this design in more details.
				Given the file name, the faraway project is always inside a wrapper.
				More precisely, if the file name is /my/dir/name/foo, then the associate wrapper is located in the folder
				Application\ Support/iTeXMac2/Projects/my/dir/name/
				or above. Which allows faraway projects to be shared by a file subhierarchy.
				In order to bind the wrapper and the source file, the wrapper will keep track of the source files.
				The included tex project will contain a list of finder aliases to the files they should be bound to.
				And soft links too.
				Managing recursivity. If a document is open, we are looking for an attached project.
				If the project is already open, we just have to verify that it knows about the document.
				If we try to open the project, we must be very careful in order to avoid recursive call.
				This method is expected to be reentrant. For that purpose, if the result is not already computed,
				it sends a willGetNewProjectForURL: message, make all the computations,
				then sends a final didGetNewProjectForURL: before it returns.
				The only purpose of these methods is just to break recursivity.

				in alphabetical order (starting from "0", "1"...) will give the list of all the projects for that name,
				ordered from the most important to the lesser one.
				When looking for an information in a project given its name,
				one iterates the list of the gathered projects and stop when a project provides the expected information.
				In general, projects at the end of the list belong to the application bundle.
