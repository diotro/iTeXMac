    @discussion If you write your own engine inspector by subclassing iTM2TeXPEngineInspector, you must make it +initialized unless it won't be registered and used.
				Built in engine inspectors are +initialized in the iTM2TeXPEngineInspector +load method.
				For inspectors not in the same framework, you just have to [ class]  them in their +load method.
